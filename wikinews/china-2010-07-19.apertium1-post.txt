Chinese government tries to contain oil spill in Yellow Sea
19 July, 2010
The Government of China sent an estimated 800 ships to try to contain the spill of crude oil that occurred in two pipelines, property of the semi-state China National Petroleum Corporation, near the port city of Dalian, northwest of said country, and one of the most important.
Firemen took almost 15 hours in extinguishing the fire, which occurred after an explosion in two pipelines that caused the spill of 1500 tonnes of crude in an area of 183 square kilometres of the Bohai Sea. Almost 80 crafts engaged in efforts of cleaning and containing the fuel.
Authorities estimate that the clean-up operation will take five more days, until when a million barrels of oil are being diverted to other installations. The accident occurred to within 100 kilometres of the coast and caused the closing of the port of Dalian. The industrial complex is one of the four biggest in China, and it is estimated that it has reserves of 19 million barrels.
